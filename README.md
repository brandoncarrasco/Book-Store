## Project Description

The bookstore uses Google Books API to retrieve books based on genres and book title. The users can create accounts, login, and add books to their cart. They can surf the page using the genres specified on the navbar, or using the searchbar (below Navbar) to search the title of their desired book. The frontend follows the single-page design paradigm and includes several dynamic features such as carousels, dropdown items, and CSS transitions.
